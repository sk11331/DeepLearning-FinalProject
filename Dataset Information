The dataset used for training and testing our real-time face verification system consists of a diverse collection of face images captured under various conditions. 
It includes images of individuals with different facial expressions, poses, and lighting conditions, ensuring robustness and generalization of the model.
Due to size limitations on GitHub, we are unable to host the entire dataset directly in the repository.
However, the dataset is available for download via the following Google Drive link
